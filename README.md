# Myriad

- Frontend written in plain JS
- Make sure that `myriadserver` is running
- It is highly recommened to use some sort of reverse-proxy setup. For reference, 
[this](https://www.deebakkarthi.com/20251231t185917-myriad/) is my setup.
- `nginx` handles all requests. It redirects `/api` requests to `myriadserver`
